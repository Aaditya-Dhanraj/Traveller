This feat is achieved generally on the fourth or fifth day that too if they are completely trained. Thus, just imagine completing something like this in three days. The most alpine meadows start around 11,000 ft. which is above the tree line. When you start trekking, you start walking down the meadows within the first 10 minutes of the trek itself.",
